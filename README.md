**Overview of the Project**

The Weather Forecast App is a web application that provides real-time weather information for any city. Users can enter a city name to get the current weather, a 5-day forecast, air quality information, and see relevant weather condition videos in the background.

**Features**
* Current Weather:  Displays the current temperature, humidity, air quality, and wind speed.
* 5-Day Forecast: Provides a 5-day weather forecast with temperature, weather condition descriptions, and icons.
* Dynamic Background Video: Changes the background video based on the current weather conditions.
* Air Quality Index: Shows the air quality index with descriptive labels (Good, Fair, Moderate, Poor, Very Poor).

**Technologies Used**
* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
* OpenWeatherMap API for fetching weather and air quality data.
* Video elements for dynamic backgrounds based on weather conditions.

**API**

This app uses the OpenWeatherMap API. You will need to get your own API key from OpenWeatherMap and replace the placeholder in 'app.js'.
